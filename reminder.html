    <h1>&#127875; My Pumpkin&#127875;</h1>
    <p>
      Thank you for being a part of my life. I have never seen any person like
      you in my life before. As I always say, you are always special to me. I
      have seen no one cry for other person's feelings. But I can see and feel
      that caring and love in you. Whatever I wanted all these years is just
      love and care. And now I am getting it from you. Don't feel low about
      yourself. You are always great in your own way. I love you when I can see
      your true colors. No need to hide your true colors from me. You are always
      my pumpkin&#127875;. Whatever you feel even shit or great, let's feel it
      together. I don't want to be part of your happiness, I want to support you
      during the time you face your storms. Let me be a part of it. You may have
      faced many problems in your life alone, but from now you are not alone.
      Let's face it together, with holding our hands and never leaving it. Don't
      feel anything to share your feelings with me. I will help you even it
      worth my life. Eventhough, everyone see you weird, you are always normal
      to me. I love you in every form of you. Just be transparent about your
      sufferings to me.
    </p>
    <h3>
      This ring is just to remind you that, I am not there for you but
      <span>always with you.</span>
